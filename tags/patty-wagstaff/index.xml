Patty Wagstaff is 72 years old at the time of this photo and here she is cutting a ribbon with the tail of her Extra Flugzeugbau EA300 only a few metres above the ground, while INVERTED!
Talk about an aviation girlboss!
I&amp;rsquo;ve actually known about Wagstaff for over a decade now thanks to her being featured in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series.</description></item></channel></rss>
