What most probably don&amp;rsquo;t associate with Florida is one of the largest aerospace expos on the North American continent.

To be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what to write about for this post, so it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a short one. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this prior to deploying this website, so if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it means I managed to avoid getting gapped by my deployment pipeline! Yippee!
As I&amp;rsquo;ve said in my about section, this blog will pretty much be me spilling my thoughts onto the internet.</description></item></channel></rss>
