What most probably don&rsquo;t associate with Florida is one of the largest aerospace expos on the North American continent. An expo so large, that
it easily rivals the renowned EAA AirVenture Oshkosh expo held in Wisconsin. I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about Sun &rsquo;n Fun.</p><h2 id=the-prelude>The Prelude</h2><p>Despite growing up as an avgeek, I hadn&rsquo;t known of Sun &rsquo;n Fun until fairly recently when I watched
aviation YouTuber <a href=http://www.youtube.com/@steveo1kinevo>steveo1kinevo</a> document his journey in flying
a TBM940 to the event. However, once I learned of its existence, I knew immediately that I had to attend. The only problem was, the event is held annually in mid April which is exactly when my university holds its final exams for the winter term.</p><p>Fast-forward to the winter of 2024. I wasn&rsquo;t enrolled in any classes for the term since I was recovering
at home after a bit of a mental health crisis the term prior. My parents suggested that we go travelling to help take my mind off life and all its stressors. They didn&rsquo;t have any particular destination in mind, and so asked me where I wanted to go. In that moment, I knew that my chance to attend Sun &rsquo;n Fun had finally come.</p><h2 id=a-rainy-start>A Rainy Start</h2><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to describe just how hyped I was as we pulled into the Sun &rsquo;n Fun campus at Lakeland Linder International Airport (KLAL). After years of attending comparatively mediocre Canadian airshows and repeatedly visiting the one decent aviation museum near my home, I was more than ready to have my socks blown off by an event which promised the absolute best of both worlds.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature had other plans as our first day at the event was soiled by a line of severe thunderstorms that rumbled through all of Northern Florida. The atmospheric setup was so potent that day, in fact, that a tornado watch had been issued for Lakeland and many surrounding areas. As expected (and very understandably), all airshow performances were cancelled for the day.</p><p>Despite this, there was still plenty to see and do in the form of countless aircraft on static display, talks being held, simulator demos, and more.</p><p><a href=/gallery/a10-thunderbolt><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53959951119_c237fd9869_b.jpg alt="Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II"></a></p><p>After admiring some mean looking military aircraft, running through torrential downpours, munching on tasty food, and watching the arrival of a pair of Fairchild Republic A-10s, we returned to our hotel to rest up for another day of Sun &rsquo;n Fun.</p><h2 id=the-true-sun-n-fun-experience>The True Sun &rsquo;n Fun Experience</h2><p>The next day, things were quite different as we once again pulled into the Sun &rsquo;n Fun campus. Instead of ominous dark clouds, the sky was completely clear, basking the campus in that characteristic Florida sunshine. Instead of rumbles of thunder, there was now the roar of afterburners as the USAF Thunderbirds ripped through the skies in their F-16C Fighting Falcons.</p><p>It was clear that today we were going to be treated to the true Sun &rsquo;n Fun experience. As soon as we passed the ticket gates, we immediately made our way to the flightline as the airshow was starting soon. The crowd there was quite impressive and, after searching a while for an optimal viewing location, we decided to settle in the shade underneath the wing of a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker.</p><p>Before long, it was time for the show to begin. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t even want to attempt an explanation of every awesome moment in the airshow, for doing so would result in a blog post the length of a law school textbook. Instead, I&rsquo;ll let my photos do the talking for me over in the gallery. If you would like to view the photos, <a href=/tags/snf2024>click here</a>.</p><p>After the airshow, we ate lunch and began exploring more of the expo campus. The campus is an absolutely gargantuan complex that occupies the entire Southern half of the airport (from Runway 10/28). It&rsquo;s so large, in fact, that the expo operates its own free on-site public transportation system to transport guests around campus. Within, you&rsquo;ll find everything from aircraft parking areas to hangars to food courts, vendor booths, and even entire plazas. Hell, there&rsquo;s even a museum and a friggin <a href=http://www.flycfaa.com/>HIGH SCHOOL</a> to top it all off! Of course, being an aerospace expo and all, you&rsquo;ll also find aircraft. But what you probably won&rsquo;t be expecting is just how many aircraft there are.</p><h2 id=planes-planes-and-more-planes>Planes, Planes, and More Planes</h2><p>Sun &rsquo;n Fun is what&rsquo;s called a fly-in. Basically, pilots are able to fly their own personal aircraft to the event, and store their aircraft on the event campus. Sun &rsquo;n Fun and Oshkosh are special in that guests who fly in to the event can also camp next to their aircraft overnight. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that access to aircraft parking and camping areas are not restricted to its users. It is considered a normal part of the campus in terms of access, meaning that anyone with an event pass can wander through<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>As we explored the campus on foot, I was utterly mindblown by just how many aircraft we were seeing. With each row of aircraft we passed, more came into view, and it wasn&rsquo;t all just the same type of aircraft either. Some areas had your run-of-the-mill single engine pistons, while others had homebuilt aircraft, STOLs, seaplanes, heavy twins, and more.</p><p>After passing through a camping zone which probably housed over a hundred aircraft, we crossed runway 5 only to find a hundred more on the other side.</p><p><img src=/imgs/IMG_1285.jpg alt="aircraft hell"></p><p>Already exhausted and with the Florida sun pushing us closer to skin cancer by the second, we called off the exploration and returned to the food court to plan our next activity. Since we still wanted to check out more areas of the campus, we opted to simply use their on-site public transit to get around instead.</p><p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve been considering all I&rsquo;m telling you carefully, you might be asking two questions:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;If the campus is located within an active airport, how were you able to walk around? Did you have an escort?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;All those aircraft you saw had to get there somehow right? They also have to leave somehow right? What were the arrivals and departures like?&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=sun-n-fun-a-pilots-chaotic-nightmare>Sun &rsquo;n Fun: A Pilot&rsquo;s Chaotic Nightmare</h2><p>The answer to the first question is (perhaps surprisingly) &ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t have an escort and we didn&rsquo;t need one&rdquo;. As I mentioned before, the aircraft parking and camping areas are all considered a normal part of the campus. As long as you have your event pass, you are free to roam more or less unsupervised as you wish. This is probably quite surprising, and it definitely was to me.</p><p>Keep in mind, the airport is very much active during the event. As long as there isn&rsquo;t an airshow performance happening, pilots are free to land/depart as desired. This means that much of the campus is comprised of active aircraft movement areas, including the aircraft parking/camping areas, and a number of taxiways.</p><p>Furthermore, most of the campus does not have dedicated pedestrian walkways. This means that when traversing these areas, you are either walking on the grass next to a taxiway, or on the taxiway itself. The taxiway is shared by pedestrians, transit and other ground vehicles, and aircraft alike. This means that if you choose to walk on the taxiway, you always need to be aware of your surroundings. Having walked on said taxiways myself, there were a few times where I had to step off into the grass in order to let an aircraft pass by. Crazy stuff, I know.</p><p>If I had to guess as to why Sun &rsquo;n Fun puts this much trust in their guests, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s because most of them are aviators themselves, and so would have plenty of experience working with/around aircraft and on aircraft movement areas. One of the announcers for the airshow mentioned this when giving the pre-show safety briefing for the audience.</p><p>The second question also has a pretty crazy-sounding answer. As mentioned, pilots can arrive/depart KLAL when there aren&rsquo;t any airshow performances occurring. With so many pilots attending the event, and for different days of the event, the arrivals/departures truly are among the world&rsquo;s best choreographed dances.</p><p>I remember observing the arrival/departure operations closely before the airshow performances began. At any given time, there were no less than 7 aircraft in the circuit all being sequenced to land, and I estimate that an aircraft was taking off or landing once every 30 seconds or less. In fact, there were often multiple aircraft landing on the same runway!<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p><a href=/gallery/double-landing><img src=https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53962448689_b0803bb2d1_b.jpg alt="Very busy"></a></p><h2 id=wrapping-up-and-takeaways>Wrapping Up and Takeaways</h2><p>After a ride around campus aboard the transit vehicle, and with the sun starting to set, we decided that it was time to say goodbye to Sun &rsquo;n Fun. While I was a little bummed out that we wouldn&rsquo;t get to see the nighttime airshow performances, I also knew that we had to drive all the way to Cocoa Beach that night and so could not spend any more time in Lakeland. And so, with the STOL pilots competing for shortest takeoff on a grass runway next to the parking lot<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, we drove out of the event campus and left Sun &rsquo;n Fun behind.</p><p>So, what are my takeaways? For one, I think this is a must-attend for anyone interested in aviation. Whether you&rsquo;re a professional in the field, weekend warrior, hobbyist, or casual planespotter, Sun &rsquo;n Fun has something for you. Hell, you can even go job hunting at their on-site career fair! That being said, if you are not experienced with being in active aircraft movement areas, I advise you to always be aware of your surroundings when traversing such portions of the event campus. As I&rsquo;ve said before, pedestrians do not get any special walkways, meaning you are sharing the same space with taxiing aircraft and ground vehicles.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a pilot + aircraft owner and are thinking about flying yourself into the event, I encourage you to first reflect on your ability to plan for and operate in very high workload scenarios. The Sun &rsquo;n Fun arrival is very complex and can become messy due to the sheer number of aircraft being sequenced at the same time. You will likely be getting quite a bit closer to other aircraft than you would during a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; landing. This means that you need to be able to remember and follow the established procedure carefully, and comply with ATC instructions promptly. Due to the extremely high rate at which these instructions need to be issued, ATC will refer to you by your aircraft type and colour instead of a callsign. In addition, you will be asked to avoid transmitting on frequency unless requested by ATC or if you have an emergency. Instead, you are to acknowledge instructions/clearances by rocking your wings. If you want an idea as to what the arrival will look like, here&rsquo;s a link to the <a href=https://youtu.be/Hb9WYZsMG40>Sun &rsquo;n Fun 2024 VFR Arrival Procedures Video</a> published by the FAA.</p><p>Oh man I really yapped a lot for this post huh. I mean, can you really blame me though? Sun &rsquo;n Fun was genuinely one of the most amazing events I&rsquo;ve ever been to, so of course I&rsquo;d have a lot to write about. Anyway that does it for this post. I probably won&rsquo;t be making another post this long for a while so if you absolutely hated reading this, rest assured that my upcoming posts will be far less torturous.</p><p>Oh, and I also want to thank you if you actually did read this whole thing. I really am just screaming into the void with this blog, so it really does mean a lot to me if you actually took time out of your day to consume all of my crazed ramblings.</p><p>See you next time!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>&ldquo;Event pass&rdquo; refers to the bracelet you receive after having your ticket checked.

When two aircraft are landing on the runway, the one in front is instructed to remain airborne over most of the runway and to land exactly on the marker placed furthest down the runway. Meanwhile, the aircraft behind is instructed to land exactly on the marker placed near the start of the runway. This procedure is only used with small aircraft and can actually be quite dangerous, especially when pilots fail to follow instructions. You will only see this being done during very large fly-ins such as Sun &rsquo;n Fun and Oshkosh.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p>You should look up STOL competition videos.
