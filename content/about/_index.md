Hey there, I'm Julian! Welcome to my personal website.

Here, I make blog posts where I expel thoughts from my brain in nearly incoherent word vomit. Oh, and I post some cool pictures I take. Sometimes.



## Okay but who is Julian?

I'm a current Mathematics undergrad at the University of Waterloo working towards a degree in statistics with a minor in computer science. I'm also
a huge avgeek who loves everything to do with aviation and aerospace, and somewhat of a weather nerd to top it all off (I sound super acoustic, I know).
