So this is my very first blog post. To be honest I don't really know what to write about for this post,
so it's going to be a short one. 
Also, I'm writing this prior to deploying this website, so if you're reading this, it means
I managed to avoid getting gapped by my deployment pipeline! Yippee!

As I've said in my [about section](/about/), this blog will pretty much be me spilling my thoughts onto the internet.
I'm not really the most eloquent author so I hope you're not expecting to find a literary masterpiece here.

Anyway, that's about it for now. I'll be posting again soon, as I've done some cool stuff recently that
I'm looking forward to writing about.

See you next time!
