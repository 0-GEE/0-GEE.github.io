Ok can we talk about how crazy this is? Patty Wagstaff is 72 years old at the time of this photo and here she is cutting a ribbon with the tail of her Extra Flugzeugbau EA300 only a few metres above the ground, while INVERTED!

Talk about an aviation girlboss!

I've actually known about Wagstaff for over a decade now thanks to her being featured in the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Because of this, she had always seemed like some sort of mythical dragon who rolled and weaved through the skies as though she had been inhabiting them for millennia. Seeing her perform her craft in the flesh was honestly kinda surreal.
