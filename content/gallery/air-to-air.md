Took this crazy cool shot of EI-EJG (Airbus A330-200) during my flight home from Sun 'n Fun back in April.

This aircraft was operating ITA Airways flight 619 from Washington D.C. (KIAD) to Rome (FCO/LIRF).

If you're ever taking a flight that cruises along the East coast of the United States, keep your eyes peeled
and your camera ready, because the upper airways there are very, *very* busy!
